# Related Work Map (Draft Scaffold)

Use this scaffold when writing the submission.

## 1. Oscillator/Analog Ising Machines

- Position this work relative to oscillator Ising machines and analog annealers.
- Distinguish objective:
  - Their focus: optimization energy landscapes.
  - Here: explicit logic-gate synthesis + addressable memory + constructive universality.

## 2. Reservoir Computing

- Clarify boundary:
  - RC often uses trained readout.
  - This phase-gate core claims logic emergence without trained readout in the
    gate/memory modules.

## 3. Neuromorphic Oscillator Logic

- Compare with phase-locked logic and synchronization-based computation.
- Emphasize implemented gate family and tested compositional pipeline.

## 4. Computability Foundations

- Anchor functional completeness via Shannon basis.
- State unbounded-memory assumption explicitly, mirroring classical TM arguments.

## 5. Non-claims Section (must appear in manuscript)

- No quantum entanglement claim.
- No quantum or complexity speedup claim.
- No hardware-unbounded-memory claim.
